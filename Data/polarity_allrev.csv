Minus a point for not informing us at the reception. Overall room is clean. Bathroom/toilet is very small. First time I ever got ""damaged"" twice while in the toilet during my shower. First my right hand swung onto the bath soap tray during shower and while drying myself outside the shower my back knocked against the metal sharp end of the shower door handle. Fortunately it was not that hard that would cause a deep painful bruise. Lastly the toilet door was not working as well. Staff: I have no issues with anyone. Everyone was very efficient and helpful. Due to the SG Clean status of this hotel, the various procedures to ensure everyone's safety from the pandemic were not that inconvenient at all. Sound out to the front office staffs from Rachel who checked us in as well as the entrance lady who'd explained clearly what we needed to do to enter the hotel premises daily. Facilities: The swimming pool was quite nice. We were only allowed an hour daily and the added step to appear at the front desk just to collect the card pass was slightly inconvenient. Would it not be more useful to allow this set hour to be programmed into our hotel room cards instead of needing to go physically collect it at the reception when using the pool?

Price was not quite value for money especially since it‚Äôs a bit expensive - I‚Äôd expect more for that kind of price. Room was small but comfy. The TV channels could have more variety and quality. The kettle was horrendous - there were brown spots at the spout. God knows what it was. Changed my mind on having a cuppa. The toilet was well stocked. Lots of towels everywhere. Can‚Äôt say the same for pillows. The toilet has no water hose at the side - probably catering to western ideals. There was a LAN or telephone port near the toilet seat which I find it to be very odd. The shower gel and shampoo were excellent (not measly). I must say that the shower door placement was odd. Water will spilled out. Perhaps realignment of how the door should be opened could prevent this. Window view was excellent. The switches were not user friendly. There was no feedback on the switches so I wasn‚Äôt quite sure whether I had turned it on or off. Aircon was excellent.,0.109,0.747,0.144,0.8067

The only great part of the stay was the check-in. Had the most friendly and helpful staff that assisted with check-in. Unfortunately, impression kind of fell to the ground when I entered the room. It looked old and had a little old smell but once the air con came on, it felt better. View was good but room wise was a lot more disappointing when I stayed with a friend at the opposite wing. Anyway, we needed an extra towel and called for one. It took almost 45minutes before it came. Which we were fine assuming that the hotel was running on minimal staffing. On the second night, I had a cut but not at the hotel's fault. We tried calling the reception to get a plaster and bottle opener but there was no answer for the 2 times we called. My friend had to head down to the lobby to get someone. But there was no one. The great thing was a staff called our room to check if we needed first-aid or just the bandaid. Glad that they were pro-active on that part. Bandaid and bottle opener came about 20mins later. Hot water in the room was temperamental. The water will be hot for 5 seconds then revert to extreme cold for 3 seconds and slowly back to hot. This cycle went on for our stay. I really liked Carlton the last time I came, so I decided to book it again this time. But to see it change so vastly is pretty disappointing and sad.

Very friendly, very helpful, very attentive but NOT in a creepy, stalker-y way. The breakfast? I would eat there all day, everyday. For such a small hotel the food selections are amazing. Seriously, I'd kidnap the chefs and lock them in my basement and force them too cook the Fullerton Bay breakfast menu for me everyday for the rest of their life. PLEASE HAVE THE CROISSANT. Best croissant ever. The bed? Dont make me start on the bed. They have a vast selections of pillows, and goddamn, the pillows! I swear they're made of baby angels' butts. The sheets are so soft they have got to be made from the skin of those baby angels, too. The only downside is the price and the room availability.

First I wrote in my booking that we were coming for my wife's birthday, I hinted it would be nice to stay on the bay side of the hotel, and would even be willing to pay for it. My request and my wife's birthday were ignored. Not even a note. So much for the much advertised personal touch. Second, the pricing policy is not at all customer friendly. We decided to stay another night, our 3rd one, and had to pay a whopping 50% higher because they did not release rooms on Agoda. Now a great hotel would have given us the same rate as the two first nights. Short term greed versus long term view.

Hence, for two nights, that‚Äôs about $400++. I can say it is abit expensive. 1)The daily breakfast was not ala carte buffet or any sort. It was just a bento set served in microwaveable plastic containers. Although the set did comes with an orange/apple, a packet of Marigold packet drink and a cup of tea/coffee. The items within the bento set served for the past two days were not worth the price(as the package I paid includes breakfast charges into it already). Examples of items served in a bento set; mee goreng with not much ingredients inside), a mini sausage, a mini croissant, two pieces of toasted white bread, a small piece of scrambled egg and three tiny slices of marbled cake. 2) Family room was a bad choice I have made. The first night there was terrible. As I was given a interconnected room(so there is an interconnected door). In the wee hours of the night, I was woken by very noisy neighbours! They were talking and laughing so loudly, and worst I think they smoked inside their room(coz the smell drifted into our room and the smell of cigarette smoke lingered in our for very long). I checked the clock and it was around 02:45am!!! I tried to make myself sleep but the persistent noise coming from our neighbours were too disturbing. Hence, I have to make a call to the service desk to ask for their assistance and at the same time informing them that their interconnected door is too thin. They mentioned that they will send a security guard to check. Thumbs up for their immediate action to resolve my situation. In the end, the very next day, I requested for a change of room and they willingly acceded to my request. Thumbs up for Ratna for assisting! They changed us to another room without the interconnected door. And Indeed the changed room was better than the previous one. No cigarette smell and sound-proofed walls!",0.054,0.911,0.036,-0.4873

Everything was okay, it was a good stay however we decided to extend 1 more night. Sadly we were informed by the recep that the room was not available and that they only had the normal alcove room. On the 7th, when we enter the new room, it was good but there was no phone to call front desk. After few hours of staying there, we fell asleep and around 7pm we woke up, the room was dark. We thought that we did not switch the lights on. However, it turned out to be a technical problem - Power trip. We had to go down and ask for help. When the technician arrived he manage to fix it but again, the power trip. It was so frustrating as we had to go down to the concierge again to inform them that there‚Äôs a power trip. The same technician came up and tell us that we need to change our room, and as I remembered it was close to 11pm! My wife & I were so exhausted after our post wed photoshoot and this was the most unexpected thing to occur to us. We had to pack up our stuffs and went down to the reception to be assigned to another room with a new key card, and that also, we had to wait! I believe that there was only 1 person at the reception, and she must have been well informed of this situation and should have attended to us immediately. When we had asked to speak to the manager in charge, the staffs told us that there was no manager in charge, and that the manager will be on shift the next day. It was a horrible experience and an unfortunate one. There was no form of customer recovery except for a late check out timed at 3pm. During check out, we had to Q as well due to the heavy check ins.

Like many 5-stars hotel, the surrounding, rooms and amenities are luxurious and the service is impeccable. What sets Capella apart from the others and impresses us, is understanding our dogs are important and reflecting that care and thoughtfulness in their actions. We have enjoyed every single minute of our stay and we are very sure our dogs have loved it too.",0.032,0.774,0.194,0.9733

Definitely recommending this hotel to all my friends! The pros : big and spacious room with balcony, staffs were all kind and polite consistently every staff is polite and service is so so good ! Consistency is crucial ! Air con temperature at the best able to adjust ! View is wonderful. Day bed is super comfortable and clean. Our room is kept very very clean ! Went to the pool, there were staffs as well! Drinks were served to us. Cons- may suggest that it‚Äôs time to change the bed mattress.. not as fluffy as I hope it would be.. but still comfortable for a good nights rest ! Probably the pool needs to be cleaned and scrubbed a little, I had a baby nephew swimming.. the ground of the pool seems dirty for little children. May suggest that hotel kindly let us know regarding the areas where our lil fur kids are allowed at, and may kindly let the staffs at pool have more knowledge as to whether are we allowed to bring the pool towel back to our room after swimming and drying ourselves.. If u have a little doggy with u, you might need to walk/trek a distance up back to the hotel if you‚Äôre going out to explore Sentosa. (Maybe can get a buggy to drive us back up? Perhaps? ). But even if it‚Äôs not allowed it‚Äôs okay.

When finally someone answered, I wanted to order in-rooming dining, the staff said the line was engaged so he couldn't transfer me. So he took my order from me and will help me call in ltr. I asked him how long would it take, he said ""I don't know, I'm just customer service."" This is bad service. I suggest for the hotel to have direct lines to e.g. housekeeping , in-room dining so guests can call the relevant depts directly rather than waiting and waiting for the one-touch line to be answered. First night I requested for firm pillows, after waiting for abt 20-30mins the pillows finally came BUT it wasn't even firm, it was the same as the other pillows that was already in the room.

She gave a lot of details to how I can enjoy my stay. And with the seating slots for breakfast and happy hours. And she even help with booking for swimming and gym facilities! Best is she is nice enough to help me with storing of a cake for my friend! Saw her the next few days during breakfast! What I love about her, is her smiley eyes! She speak with so much experience/passion of her job! Really love my stay due to her as well! Stayed for 2 nights. So for breakfast at the lounge, was served by CY, Jiale and Alvies. They were amazing! They accommodate to all my request and even though I was very specific with my orders and quite troublesome! As I know what I want and enjoy. But they did it with a smile (I suppose as they all are wearing mask!) and they speak with very good profession! Despite some delay at the second day breakfast! But everything was great! And my friend is happy with everything as well! Thanks you for such an amazing job! Only downside, is their Asian delight breakfast. The plain porridge was really tasteless. And there should not be any expectations towards that selection at all. And was weird that Mocha was only served after breakfast. As my friend wanted Mocha for breakfast as it was good, but not available during breakfast. Next downside was, I was celebrating my friend birthday. And I was promise a card/cupcake from my request. However it wasnt there for any of the days we stayed. So sad. We truly enjoyed our stay! And would definitely go back there again! As the staffs were great!

The room itself is fine cus we booked a club room for their bathtub but if u were thinking to stay at their normal room you can forget it cus its not worth the money. U can get cheaper rates for nicer hotels. The location wise is good but u can also get nicer hotels ard there. Received an email prior to our stay from the property for our needs, replied them what we kinda expected but no action taken from them. Not that we expected something out of someone‚Äôs birthday but they didnt even go the extra mile. But whatever, that aside. We kinda get the ‚Äúwe dont like kids‚Äù vibe there cus we have 2 toddlers and their reason for giving us that look or treatment is cus of ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù. I mean like i dont mind not getting to their club lounge cus we dont drink but pool seriously? I mean that‚Äôs what we are looking forward to. we went there on freaking weekdays and while we were there the pool were always empty so i dont see why they cant put their ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù aside for an hr or two cus its someone‚Äôs birthday or maybe make someone‚Äôs day or something idk? Then their rooftop pool is dirty with dried leaves i think they dont bother clearing unlike their infinity pool which we saw them cleaning on that night. Then upon check out, we actually req a late check out on arrival but we receive a call like some miscom they should have like input in the system or something but ya. Also their lifts check in check out reception is all over the place so inconvenient. Thats all. Overall is 1)not kid friendly 2)not valued for money ok thanks for reading.

Friendly, courteous and very helpful. Upon arrival, we wanted to deposit our bags before checking in, so that we could go grab a bite; the staff attending to us at the door immediately made us feel welcome, taking over our bags promptly. We also enjoyed Happy Hour and breakfast at the Club Room. To the gent that helped me check on the coffee machine in the room, I am sorry I am an idiot and thought it was faulty when I didn't turn it on properly, and thank you so much for your patience! However, I cannot honestly recommend this hotel to anyone without addressing some of the little things that contributed to our (eventual) annoyance. My fiance and I felt that the cleanliness and facilities is lacking. After checking in, we went to our room, but had to wait for about half an hour before our bags were sent to us. We get that it may be a busy time for the staff, so we could understand, but that window of time made us snoop around to kill time, and we found that the room wasn't as clean as we liked it to be. There were mug water marks and coffee stains on the coffee table, bits of black stuff (plastic?) on the TV console, and the bathtub felt quite grimy. These are small issues that I could take care of quite quickly, but it just feels like more care could have gone into housekeeping. But the parapet outside the floor-to-ceiling glass window- man, they were filthy. Bits of dried leaf and caked dust I understand, but it is strewn with cigarette butts, presumably from higher floors than the one we were staying at. The sight of it is quite horrible- the curtains stayed drawn for the entire time we were there. Then, on facilities- we both felt that in this day and age, at least let us have a ready HDMI port access to the nice TV in the room. We'd much prefer to stream media from our own laptops, but we found that the port is not that easily accessible. If there is an additional HDMI port on",0.076,0.829,0.094,0.7566

Should really have gone for the AWAY or WOW Suite but could not justify the prices that were double that of a Garden Villa at Capella - did not make any sense. Figured out why when I was there - they only had 1 AWAY and 2 WOW Suites - talking about extreme scarcity which undoubtedly drove up the price. The AWAY Room plunge pool was a tad too shallow - I would have preferred a deeper pool (like the one at Capella). However, given the hotel's location, there was a lot more variety in terms of dining options compared to Capella. Service was better than I recall (this is our 8th stay at W Singapore). Although there were no activities for the kids (unlike Capella), we managed to occupy ourselves mainly with a deck of Monopoly Deal, which has become a favourite past-time for the family since we came home.",0.015,0.845,0.14,0.974

I went down to the hotel a few days earlier and requested for early check-in. The request was granted and made known only after I make a call in the morning to follow up. If the confirmation was received earlier, we would have been able to check-in much earlier to enjoy the great and beautifully designed facilities provided. Upon arrival, the check-in was smooth and pleasant. It was very thoughtful of the hotel to provide a kind care-kit for every guests. The room is very tidy and clean. It also has a view of the sky garden, though the plants do block much of the city view. But nevertheless, it felt like being in a jungle in the middle of the urban sprawl. We are very happy that they managed to arrange for the room with bathtub as we understand that not all the room type that we reserved comes with bath tub. We finally managed to have a great soak to relax my mind. We also managed to book the use of the gym and swimming pool much earlier. The only comment is that the pool water is frigid cold. We wished they would add some hot water into the pool. Aside from that, we also noticed the pavilion base were rusting very badly. Perhaps a good time to refurbish the pool to include a water heater perhaps. The gym is very spacious and comfortable to work out too. And the Lime Restaurant food is amazing. And it is very reasonably priced too considering the 30% off complimentary for stay-in guests. Overall, We had a very nice and relaxing stay and wished for it to have lasted longer.

We were very grateful to have been allotted a room with a good view of the gardens and enjoyed exploring every facet of the building. Next to it is one of the best Hawker centres in Singapore so you get a taste of what it‚Äôs like to enjoy the cosmopolitan cuisine that defines the island‚Äôs culinary heritage. The very act of dining in such an establishment has been elevated to a UNESCO heritage worthy activity! A modern mall with some of the best restaurants is also just across the street. Chinatown for those interested is just a hop, skip and jump across a major road. The infamous Hyde Park of Singapore named Hong Lim where locals can vent their frustrations and protest without a license is surrounded with CCTV. This Island is Disneyland with the death penalty... perhaps that‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs safe to walk the streets in the middle of the night in this police state. Too bad the restaurant‚Äôs food is sub par. The high tea was deplorable with bad jams and sad clotted cream accompanying disappointing scones. The selection of savoury and sweets was also very much a hit and miss affair which for the price you are paying is just obscene. you deserve much much better. The hall of the restaurant is cavernous and tastefully decorated but the limited tea selection is a local copy of the famed Mariage Fr√®res. Decent but still a cheap copy. Try the many others available in a real 5 star establishment around. Bed is among the largest we have seen and sleeps 3 very comfortably. For those with children or an extra adult, it is guaranteed for a good night‚Äôs sleep. The pool unfortunately was positively filthy and this is with limited number of people using it due to COVID. I expected higher standards of cleanliness. The toilets had no soap!!! The dispensers were hidden in a cabinet below the sink! Now that is cheap... despite these misses.

Staff arranged a cake for our anniversary. Everything in the room was great, except that i saw about 3-4 strands of hair on a new towel. Very limited choices for breakfast given the price we paid. One of the waitress auntie was pretty rude (the lady who bunned up her hair, serving tables near to the food counters). When we wanted to pass her our order form, she shouted at us and asked us to wait? Also, i saw that she threw new plates on the tables while cleaning the tables during preparations. I even sighted from a distance that she dropped one of the cutleries on the floor, AND SHE PUT IT BACK ON THE TABLE FOR THE NEXT GUEST TO USE YUCKS. No replacement nor wiping it clean. So we avoided her at all costs. When i requested for a cup of tea refill from the manager, he signalled to that auntie again and she served us. She acknowledged but carried on working on her cleaning and replacing new tablewares and seems to have no intention to serve us. We waited for a while before she unwillingly asked me what i wanted, before pouring the hot tea in a gushing manner into my cup. Totally ruined my morning. If Lime restaurant is understaffed, please hire more people.

Maybe once in a long while...,"Booked the Lifestyle room for a staycation to celebrate a special occasion with my partner. The hotel exterior and interior looks fab as an urban jungle, but customer service and facilities can be better. Issue with slot booking for usage of swimming pool: - Before the stay: Was informed by the hotel that reservations for usage of the pool was required during this period for safe distancing measures and they asked me for my preferred time slot 2 days prior to my stay. I replied within 8 minutes and was shocked to be informed the next day that all slots were taken up, leaving me with time slots that were either before my check-in time (3pm), too early for me to swim (6-7am or 7-8am) or after my check-out time (12pm). Called in to clarify and was told that I could only use the pool facilities as a staying guest, meaning I was only left with early morning slots which I didn‚Äôt wanted... Eventually they managed to make arrangement and booked a slot for me at 3pm on my check-in day and 7am on my check-out day. - During my stay: During checking in, I double checked with the counter for my pool slots and to my shock, they weren‚Äôt able to find my 7am booking for the next day but that‚Äôs ok. We headed to the pool immediately after checking in (luckily we reached earlier for check in - the queue for checking in is damn long and we managed to get to the pool by 3pm), they stopped us from entering the pool premises as other patrons were still using the pool. We were informed that the patrons inside were from the previous time slot and while it‚Äôs past their allocated time for usage of the pool, they continued frolicking in the pool as no one was there to control and facilitate the crowd as the next wave of patrons arrive and waited outside for their turn to enjoy their time at the pool. Sanitary needs much more improvement: - New pool towels reeked of sweat smell, super off-putting as the stench was so bad - No sanitizing of pool facilities like the sun loungers and benches in",0.078,0.823,0.099,0.8225

A day before my check in, i emailed them as there is no email from them regarding the staggered time and they didnt reply so i called directly to the hotel‚Äôs reservation line and the staff told me to check in after 3pm. So i went at 3pm and shocked to see the long queue to check in and i queued 1hr to get my room and guess what, the staff said no pool slots were made under my name and that pool was fully booked for both days and asked me to try my luck by going down to the pool to see if theres any no-shows. Ridiculous. So i texted agoda in the chat as i was really disappointed and agoda replied saying there is a slot booked under my name for the 2nd day. So before i go for my dinner i decided to stop by the pool and check the list. MY NAME IS ON THE LIST FOR BOTH DAYS. So i guess it wasnt agoda‚Äôs fault but the hotel itself becos the hotel staff told me as i requested it on agoda, they cannot trace back who did the reservation for me. The hotel staffs‚Äô service was overall quite pleasant, their attitude and all is good. But the whole system is just so wrong? I dialed for housekeeping using their room phone and i was put on hold music for close to 10mins like as if im calling a customer service hotline which was strange as i‚Äôve stayed at so many hotels before i didnt experience this before. The buffet at lime restaurant wasnt fantastic too.

Managed to surprise my partner when the blinds were drawn up. The Management is sweet enough to do up a pair of love swans towels, accompanied with some rose petals laid out in a heart shape for our anniversary, and provided some free gifts as well to welcome us. The Butler, Gurvin is professional, nice and friendly. He volunteered to carry our luggages and introduce us to the 2 level suite. The butler service are generally great, but could take awhile to respond at nighttime (think they have knocked off), and sometimes the person turning up might be different. Kevin is nice enough to offer us some b&j ice creams at our doorstep upon knowing that my guests had arrived. The only downside might be the maximum capacity allowed is 5, including you and your other half, leaving you to only be able to invite 3 more guests for a 2 storey suite. If only they would increase it to 8 max capacity including the hosts. And yes, they are very strict about it. Love the pool, it‚Äôs huge, and not that crowded. You could totally let your hair down and enjoy the loving moments with your partner. You could also get the butler to help you book a swimming time slot there. Buggy ride would also be offered when you wish to travel around RWS, just give the butler a ring. My guests and my partner really enjoyed chilling out at the outdoor jacuzzi. There is an indoor jacuzzi as well, which is directly under the ocean view. My partner and I can‚Äôt get enough of it, we were constantly being drawn in by the wonderful marine animals, swimming freely and some playfully, in the tank, while we enjoy our jacuzzi. I would recommend this suite if you want a true get away, trust me, I could stay in the room and watch the fishes, stingrays, manta rays and sharks etc swimming.

Once Mr Willy buggy me to my room, I was brought to a room tour by him. He showed me around and is very informative. He told me that if I need a buggy ride I could call this number. I felt very luxurious and well taken care off. He even took care of our breakfast , queries, picking up my guest from lobby to our room. Thank you for being part of my important day.

Disappointing 5* service ","Firstly, before I even booked our weekend staycay, I called them to check if the suites have doors separating the bedroom from living area, and was thoroughly assured they did. Upon booking 3 rooms via Agoda, I made explicit requests through Agoda (no response from hotel), then through the hotel concierge via the phone (couldn‚Äôt get through for 2 days, they took another 2 days to call me back, but finally did) for interconnected rooms and baby cots to be placed in 2 rooms. I was assured they‚Äôd be taken care of. Upon arrival, I waited more than 20 minutes to check in. It was a crowded Saturday, granted, and the lines were long, but I was standing there pregnant with bags, and the nice Caucasian manager who was walking around failed to notice and offer me any consideration or help. Not 5* service. Or maybe just not nice people. Checked in, got to our suite, there was no sliding door where there should‚Äôve been to separate the bedroom from living area, which means I couldn‚Äôt let baby sleep in the bedroom while we were in the living room. WHAT GOOD IS A SUITE WITHOUT A DOOR? Phone lines to front desk were so busy, another 20 min later I got through and kudos to them, they managed to get me another suite with a separating door 20 min after that. Bad start to staycay.

Interior is great since there is a partition between the bedroom and an extra couch/small living living room beside the mini bar for chatting while watching tv.

The staff and security personel also realize that and apologize and i informed them they are the one who is banging our door knob but we just ignore and dont mind complaining in the reception as actually its the fault of the management that given the room is a connecting room you shouldnt give it to 2 different guest but instead to a family to prevent such issues!

From the start to the very end i dont find any enjoyment staying here. We stay here for 3 Days 2 nights. The moment we enter in this hotel, there is no one to escort us in and direct us to the counter, mind you, we came in quite late at 4.30 pm and definitely there is no one in the queue. My husband was carrying 3 luggage and 1 baby pram while i was carrying my baby, there is this staff, pass by us and just ask, "" Do you need help?"" What type of question is that?! My husband straight away say ""NO"", and she just walk off. I can't believe it! Than comes the check in process. A guy by the name of Zulfadli attend us. Not even looking in the eye. Just proceed everything without explaining a clear instruction! I am not sure if he have a problem with us or what. We asked for an upgrade and we don't mind paying it, and his response was, '' Its fully booked "". I'm really curious, on weekdays and its is fully booked? Are you sure? And he is not even a smiling at us nor look at us. Is smile really expensive here in this hotel?! For the room, there is nothing special to us. We have been to better hotels than this. Breakfast, I'm not sure why only this place allow 1 set each person whereby other hotels allow unlimited orders. Worst part, the first day of our breakfast, one of our breakfast did not reach to our table. Do we call for it? Nope. Whats the point. Mind you, we are a frequent ''Staycationer'', so we know what is service call like. Overall, service here is terrible, and I guess they need to treat everyone equally. Its not that we stay here for free and we expect nothing much but a smile. We were soo disappointed that we check out much earlier than expected.

It's rather close to some hot places in SG such as orchard and MBS. But in my case of staycation, the priority is about staying indoor and enjoying the facility inside. Their facility is a bit average, with a small and not so beautifull view pool, you can only amuse children. The jacuzzi is not hot at all, the main pool is so small, and the big cute round benches are closed (idk why, maybe due to covid? but the pool is open). Their gym also very standard (i didn't come there, only my hubby). He's not a picky person, but he said that there wasn't many types of machine. I love their room since it's big enough. But their bathroom is a bit small, and i feel really stuffy especially in the bath tub. Most of recent hotel has a open area bath tub, but the bath tub in this hotel is located behind your bathroom door, in the corner. But, i love their tub. It feels sturdy. The morning breakfast is delicious, but so little option to choose. Maybe it's due to covid, but it was not a buffet so i can't choose whatever i want. And when i asked for more bacons (which i LOVE), they said that the portion is fixed and i can't have more.",0.011,0.854,0.135,0.9896

Firstly we were not greeted upon entering and we were the only ones there. Did not feel welcome! We asked for a possibility room upgrade to the oasia room for which was available but was told that it would be chargeable though we‚Äôve gotten this several times at many other hotels. Secondly and most importantly was that the swimming pool has to be booked in advance because of the covid precautions. Understandable but never was this mentioned on the booking site. We never managed to get a slot as it is a fist come first serve basis on a 90 minute block. This dropped the value of price paid as you can get similar hotels with no pools at a way lower price. Lastly and not being too petty on this but we were slightly disappointed that nothing special was arranged for the wife though we mentioned it was her birthday in the booking.

The pool on the roof is awesome. Incredible views from the pool day and night. Pool is open late too. The only complaint we had is that Naumi gives a ""free drink"" card on check in (with a giant Singapore Sling cocktail on the front of the card). Turns out these drink coupons are only good for a wine or beer in the lobby bar and not at the pool bar, even though they just bring the drinks up from the lobby anyways. Why put a giant picture of a Singapore Sling on the card if it's not included? I get that this is a small gripe and it didn't take away from the overall stay, but they shouldn't even give these coupons out if there are so many unclear restrictions with them.

We stayed in the habitat room on the 8th floor and had a nice little view of the city skyline. The room was cleverly designed and very comfortable. The rooftop pool is wonderful. Really beautiful view of the skyline and nice deck to relax on! The only downsides were that the pillows were too high and firm and the hotel gym is very, very small and split over 3 floors, not ideal but we still managed to get a few workouts in with the limited space and equipment. Other than that, we would definitely stay here again. Really central location with lots of eateries and shopping (raffles city, Fushan, Bugis mall) within walking distance.

The rooms were new an clean. The construction noise was loud during the day time but it didn't affect us as we were out during the day. The breakfast was very limited and poor by the standard of the hotels in Bangkok. We also requested for airport transfer which we we quote a fare double compared to Grab taxi. So don't use their airport transfer. The check in was ok but the staff was not particularly friendly. The staff asked about our departure time which we said was 6am because we had a 9am flight to catch. We didn't know we could request for packed breakfast. They didn't even inform us or offer to pack the breakfast for us even knowing that we are checking out at 6am and that we would missed our breakfast which was only available at 630am. They told us 6am at first. During check out, they wanted to charge us for a pair of room slipper. By the way don't use their room slipper because they were used by many other people and very unhygienic. We told them we didn't take the room slipper and it might have been moved to another room of ours. 2 or 3 of their staff frantically went upstairs to look for the missing slipper. They found it in another room and told us check out was ok! most hotels provide new disposable slippers for guest. If the hotel wants to charge the guest for the slippers, they should clearly lable it or mention it somwhere. I thought it was pretty that 2-3 on grown adults on walkie talkie frantically looking for a pair of dirty slipper during check out. My feeling is that the management and staff of this hotel lacks integrity and honesty. From the very start trying to rip us off with the airport transfer, the not letting us know about the packed breakfast and finally trying to charge us for a pair of used slipper. Communication was poor from the outset too. Took them a few days just to reply an email. Location was fine - it is a good 10mins walk to the BTS.

My husband and myself visited and work in Asia regularly over the last twenty years and both love it. Unfortunately we booked for the Valentine meal to celebrate my 60th Birthday, we had only eaten in the hotel prior to the event, we feel the meal made my husband and my cousin very ill during the early hours of the morning and the following day, his wife and I had only vegetarian food. We reported the problem to the hotel and haven't had a reply or a further response. Sadden that this happened especially as it was the most expensive meal we had during our whole holiday. A sad event at the end of an excellent stay. If we had eaten elsewhere during the day or the night before, this review wouldn't have been written.",0.073,0.811,0.116,0.8718

Apparently writing this nearly a year later but is fresh in our minds. Staff was so helpful and kind they helped us with early checkin with upgrade to really good rooms with the view. The upgrade was worth every penny. We liked the ferry ride and took that quite often to all places in town. The hotel provided taxi and ticket for zoo/safari was bit costly I was bit late in planning early through other platform so had to choose the hotel one but it was very good experience as we could take the same vehicle for safari ride as well. Very much liked the breakfast. Being vegetarian the options were limited but they were good. View from room infinity pool all are superb!!,0.024,0.708,0.267,0.9922

The room had not been properly cleaned. There were hairs on the carpet and wooden parts of the floor, shower with smears from soap etc. Simply inexcusable. . Changes to the complimentary drinks voucher now excludes beer. A fruit cocktail must take longer to make and cost the hotel more than a simple small draught beer. So why do it? The garden, paths and fish ponds to the side of the hotel were not being swept daily as in previous years so that dead bamboo leaves were everywhere. The staff are as helpful and pleasant as ever, the breakfast extensive and the hotel ferryboat to the shopping area dependable. We just got the impression, sadly, after visiting the Chatrium on a regular basis for the past 6 years, that standards have slipped and perhaps the ownership has changed, but not for the better.

The photos on Agoda are completely misleading. I have been coming to Bangkok since 2014 almost once a year and this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

Despite our repeated request for a room with view and at a higher floor we were allocated a room in between the 4th and the 5th floor. Getting to our room from the elevator was extremely challenging and they didn't have the courtesy to send a bell boy with us so that we can find the room easily.

The toilet stink so much that we had to buy our own air freshener to get rid of that. Our room had windows overlooking the garage next door. So, no sunlight at all.

When we got to our room, we were told that we would not be allowed to open our balcony, and everytime we wanted to go out we needed to call reception for someone to let us out...this was (in there mind) due to safety of our baby. Now, as much as I am all for safety and totally appreciate where they are coming from, no parent in their right mind would let their child out on those balconies. However, I don't think us having a baby should impact our stay with regard to the freedom of opening and closing the balcony, as we are responsible for our own child's safety.

There is no mention of that on the hotel's website, nor I was told during a couple of telephone calls I had to make some special arrangement. I was actually tempted to cancel. Then I asked for a limousine service to the airport, and I was told they would contact me in the morning of the following day to confirm. As nobody called, at around 2pm I called them and they answered quite rudely that the service had already been booked - kind of, why are you bothering us with your call?

A great example is when our floor butler noticed my Allen Edmonds shoes were a bit dirty.

I was touched at the kindness and respect shown to him by other members of the staff who graciously help him to get around. At the Bamboo Bar you will find a great barman who will make you one of his signature cocktails . Then kick back and enjoy the truly talented Jazz singer from America and the equally impressive saxophone and piano player all genuine professional musicians. When I arrived at the hotel I was unwell .No problem ,the Hotel has a fabulous nurse and a Doctor on the premisses .They gave me a test and had the results three hours later and supplied me the required medicine as well.Try that at another hotel,or anywhere for that matter.

First thing you'll notice when you enter the lobby. Food: Flow restaurant was not available.

The Picnic Hamper at 360 rooftop was great though. The Lantern pastries were great. The breakfast buffet was fresh. Overall, the food was great. POOL: The pool was a bit outdated, the tiles were worn out, the roof as well. It needs renovation too. The beach/pool bean bags and seats were not that clean. We needed to turn the cushion over because there were bird poop on it. Room: King Premium had enough space for two. It was well taken care of, and cleaned. Except the mini bar had dust on it so did the side table and phone. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower, and tub. It was clean. I had asked for the river view room, and they granted it. They also let us check out late at 2pm. Spa: You can opt to have a massage in the Spa or by the pool. I had it by the pool. It was great. Fresh air, and the masseuse was good too.

If you plan on doing a staycation (living in Bangkok) and just want to stay in the hotel, then it's a good option to be in.

They advertise all the usual things you would expect from a 5 star hotel but don't provide them. I understand the covid situation is difficult, but they should update the website to show what's actually available. They advertise multiple restaurants but only 1 is open, so your dining choices are Japanese or Japanese. When I checked in I was informed there was no room service, no buffet breakfast. They do provide a set menu breakfast but apart from the toast it was inedible. Cold coffee and bad food. They advertise afternoon tea, but that's not available either, in fact almost none of the things you would expect. This hotel is operating with a skeleton staff and it shows. I went downstairs to try to talk to a member of staff at 9pm and it took me 10 minutes of searching before I could find one single staff member. To be fair, when I complained about the lack of facilities they 'upgraded' me to a better room, however the room was not significantly different. It was ok, but the toilet was so small you could not even turn around (no exaggeration). Finally, I had a small accident that left some blood on the sheets and 2 small spots on one of their bathrobes. I soaked the sheets and the blood came out, I didn't even notice the blood on the robe. However, they claim the bathrobe cannot be cleaned and tried to charge me 5,000 baht for a new one. I could buy that robe (minus the Nikko crest) for 1000 thb in Home pro. We eventually 'agreed' I would pay 2,000 thb. I am a retired Airline Captain and have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world but have never had to deal with anything like this.

However, I found the reception staff to be unhelpful. It immediately put me off when upon checkin they insisted on a 3,000b deposit. The money itself didn‚Äôt bother me but to be told that I wouldn‚Äôt get the money refunded for upto a month if I paid on debit card really put me off. As a result I had to get money out of the cash machine onsite. In addition, on the Friday night I requested some soya milk so I could have an evening drink and was told there‚Äôs a 7/11 round the corner and to go there. I found this really unhelpful. No offer to find me any. I ended up checking with the restaurant (as it was on my floor) and she said they didn‚Äôt have any in stock but she would make sure it was there the next day. I also found the location a bit far away down the river. The boat currently finishes at 6pm.

He made some coments in Thai,so they couldn't understand him.He was very unhappy that few Chinese needed to enter the elevator with us as he was showing us the room.Chinese were just left behind to find their room by themselves?! In the morning guy who was working in the brekfast area had a sassy attitude while serving us our gift drinks. After when my friend has asked him if he can take a mug with his coffee into the room he said no.When he asked to get a plastic glass, so he can finish his coffee in the room he said YES, just because he was lazy to bring a glass.

The room, which had a large balcony over-looking the river, was enormous. Everything about the hotel gave the impression that it had been built when land was cheaper in Bangkok, and at that time ago it was quite grand. The staff are helpful, and business like. However, the whole place needs money spent on it. The owners have not kept it up to standard. The room ceiling lighting did not work at all, and so it was too dark. The buffet breakfast was served in the restaurant, so you could not eat on the out-door terrace beside the river. In fact, they did not seem to take advantage of being right on the river at all. The Wi-fi only worked in the lobby. The street in which it is set, and all of that part of town, leaves something to be desired, and is not an appropriate setting for such a large hotel.It's a shame, because with a little change of attitude by those in charge it could be a much better experience.

You are literally nestled amongst warehouses on the Chao Praya River with sweaty, muscled boys hauling boxes to/from lorries and boats. One gets the feeling that this part of Old Bangkok is on the cusp of exploding into a very trendy/chic part of town with similar boutique hotels, residences, mini-spas and coffee shops popping up all around. It's 3 minutes walk to Wat Pho, 10 minutes walk to the Grand Palace and a 5 Baht/5 minute ferry ride to Wat Arun (Temple of the Dawn). The hotel's staff were very resourceful and polite - I asked them to ask Hertz to deliver our rental car to the hotel on our final morning (done with smiles!). We also got some great ideas on what to do and where to shop from the glamorous and polite Khun Em. The breakfast (included) was superb with a wide range of offerings for the very hungry to the very fussy with excellent coffee/tea selection as well. The rooms were modern, spartan chic - which I love (hate busy, complicated, fussy rooms) - and the bed was well-appointed and comfortable. Aircon was strong and quiet. Half the rooms have a wonderful view of the Chao Praya River and Wat Arun. One must scale stairs to get to the rooms but hey, we have legs and can walk (and the porter discretely took our bags up for us upon arrival).

We got to our room to discover it wasn't the one we had booked. We booked the River View Deluxe (after deciding it was worth the extra cost) but the room we were given was the Wat Po Deluxe. We went down to reception and stated this and reception told us that those rooms were limited and were filled on a ""first come first served"" basis. Naturally, we questioned how we were able to book an unavailable room and asked what our options were as we did not want to stay in the room we were in as this was totally different to the room we had booked. They told us that we could upgrade to the suite and pay the extra $200-and-some dollars which we were obviously not going to do. We asked if we could cancel and go somewhere else as they had mis-sold us the room but they told us that we would not get a refund. We asked again what our options were and they couldn't give us any and referred us to Agoda. At no point did we receive any sympathy or understanding from the Hotel, only hostility. We contacted Agoda and explained and Agoda paid the difference to upgrade us to the suite (many thanks to Joelson Tang). The hotel were NOT happy about this and made it known to us that Agoda were paying the extra and not the hotel. They begrudgingly led us up to the suite on the top floor which is marvellous. Stand alone bath, great views and huge. Upon check out the following day, we were asked to sign a sheet which we only questioned because we thought it might be related to covering the cost of the move to the suite. When we looked at the sheet it was a bill for a broken glass in our original room (we didn't even unpack in that room) and for 2 bottles of water we had consumed in the suite. We contested these as we hadn't broken the glass and the price list in the room said that the water was free (apparently only if you purchase a spirit). We argued some more and they wrote it off and couldn't wait to see",0.096,0.832,0.072,-0.8641

The staff was very friendly and carried our luggage up four flights of stairs as there is no elevator at this hotel. They will also take your luggage back down to the lobby when it is time for you to check-out. We didn't mind having to take the stairs but I would guess that this may be troublesome for some people. There are also tons of shops, restaurants and street food stalls all within a few blocks walking distance which was really great. There are also plenty of Tuk Tuks in the area should you need to grab one. The hotel upgraded our room to one with a view of Wat Pho and also decorated our bed with a ""Kissing Swans"" towel decoration for our Honeymoon. Breakfast was included in our hotel package and we enjoyed it on the restaurant's patio overlooking the Chao Praya River. There was a handful of choices to pick from and we were easily able to find something that suited us. There is also a rooftop bar that serves some great drinks and offers some appetizers as well. There is an awesome view of the entire area from up there and we enjoyed watching all the boats and dinner cruises go by throughout the evening. There were only a few negatives that we encountered. The first being that there were tiny ants all over our bed but after a few hours they seem to have disappeared. I also saw a lot of these in the neighborhood and would assume that they are a problem at most places in the area. The shower is only slightly tinted so you can see through into the shower from the rest of the room but since we are a couple this didn't bother us at all but might bother friends or non couples traveling together.

Then, we had to take an elevator to level R. After that, from level R we had to take another elevator to level 25. The problem comes when you realize there is only 1 lift to take for each of these routes. There can be delays for up to 30 minutes just waiting for the SINGLE lift during peak hours! The property developer should have just went for centralized elevator lobby. I can only recommend staying here if you want a cheap property for large families and you can tolerate the exhausting journey from car park to your room every time.

Can be improve by providing some utensils for cooking so that customers can prepare meals instead of going out. It was a bit pack and traffic was unorganized during peak hours. So we were held up for some time upon going in to check-in as well to check-out. Can be improve much better by providing waiting area for cars and bikes elsewhere instead of the front entrance.

We arrived the restaurant at 9:35am, ordered once but the staff took our order again when he saw our food was still not served at 10:00am, in the end breakfast was only served to us at 10:15am. Breakfast was supposed to be until 10:30am due to the MCO restrictions; though they gave us the freedom stay on and didn't ask us to leave at 10:30am, waiting 40 minutes for the same breakfast served to everyone else was kinda unacceptable, especially for a veteran hotel like Hilton.

The metro station is a few meters away. The location is perfect and that's where the good part ends. The restaurant is severely overpriced for a rather drab menu. The real problem was that the attitude of the staff was extremely poor and not befitting of the brand Melia is known to carry. I do get that it was offered at a much lower rate than the usual because of the Covid crisis but that doesn't mean you treat your guests any lesser. The water bottles weren't replaced on a regular basis each day. Every request to get water bottles were treated with scorn. I had to walk to the 24 hour mart in the wee hours of morning to buy myself water after I was told they ran out of stock rather rudely ! I will not recommend it to anyone I know unless they have location as their only priority. Hospitality is all about attitude and that too the right kind.,0.123,0.821,0.056,-0.8956

However, as the check in time is 3 pm, I am quite disappointed as I didn't managed to get my room key right on time. It was delayed until 3.40pm with a reason that the hotel was fully booked a day before. I understand the situation however it was not supposed to be put on the customer's shoulder. The bath tub stopper didn't worked properly, but that was fine as they sent their maintenance staff to check upon it after I called the receptionist and it worked just fine right after. On top of that, I called the receptionist asking for the wifi ID and password, they said it is stated on the key holder that they gave to me upon checking in, however they were none stated there. (I even took picture of the holder), I guess they were rushing to pass me the key, they forgotten to jot down the details. The way the staff talked on the phone also is not really friendly as if he was annoyed I asked the question, hence I just use my mobile data throughout my staycation there. Other than 3 points I stated up here, everything else was superb. The room, the cleanliness is top notch.",0.063,0.852,0.085,0.7249
